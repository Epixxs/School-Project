    <h2 class="main-head">Javascript - Dynamic client-side scripting</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex
      things on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there
      and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely
      content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling
      video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

    <h3 class="sub-head">Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is arguably more difficult to learn than related technologies
      such as HTML and CSS. Before attempting to learn JavaScript, you are
      strongly advised to get familiar with at least these two technologies
      first, and perhaps others as well. Start by working through the following
      modules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Getting started with the web</li>
      <li>Introduction to HTML</li>
      <li>Introduction to CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Having previous experience with other programming languages might also
      help.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      After getting familiar with the basics of JavaScript, you should be in a
      position to learn about more advanced topics, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Javascript in depth, as taught in our JavaScript Guide.</li>
      <li>Web API's</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br />
    <h3 class="sub-head">Modules</h3>
    <p>
      This topic contains following modules, in a suggested order for working
      through them.
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript first steps</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental
        questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and
        "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your first
        practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some
        key JavaScript features in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers
        and arrays.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>JavaScript building blocks</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key
        fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered
        types code block such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and
        events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in
        passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>Introducing JavaScript objects</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features
        like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript.
        You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions
        and variables into efficient packages. The object-oriented nature of
        JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with
        your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore
        we've provided this module to help you. Here we teach object theory and
        syntax in detail, look at how to create your own objects, and explain
        what JSON data is and how to work with it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>Asynchronous JavaScript</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        In this module we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is
        important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential
        blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>Client-side Web API's</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        When writing client-side JavaScript for web sites or applications, you
        won't go very far before you start to use APIs — interfaces for
        manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the
        site is running on, or even data from other web sites or services. In
        this module we will explore what APIs are, and how to use some of the
        most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.
