    <h2>Javascript - Dynamic client-side scripting</h2>
    <font size="4px">
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement
        complex things on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just
        sit there <br />and display static information for you to look
        at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
        graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, <br />or more—you can bet that
        JavaScript is probably involved.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is arguably more difficult to learn than related technologies
        such as HTML and CSS. Before attempting to learn JavaScript, you are
        strongly advised <br />to get familiar with at least these two
        technologies first, and perhaps others as well. Start by working through
        the following modules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting started with the web</li>
        <li>Introduction to HTML</li>
        <li>Introduction to CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having previous experience with other programming languages might also
        help.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After getting familiar with the basics of JavaScript, you should be in a
        position to learn about more advanced topics, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript in depth, as taught in our JavaScript Guide.</li>
        <li>Web API's</li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />
      <h3>Modules</h3>
      <p>
        This topic contains following modules, in a suggested order for working
        through them.
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript first steps</p>
      <ul type="none">
        <li>
          In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental
          questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?",
          and <br />"what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through
          your first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we
          discuss some key <br />JavaScript features in detail, such as
          variables, strings, numbers and arrays.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>JavaScript building blocks</p>
      <ul type="none">
        <li>
          In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key
          fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered
          types <br />code block such as conditional statements, loops,
          functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course,
          <br />but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Introducing JavaScript objects</p>
      <ul type="none">
        <li>
          In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features
          like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of
          JavaScript. <br />You can even create your own objects to encapsulate
          related functions and variables into efficient packages. The
          object-oriented nature of JavaScript is <br />important to understand
          if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and
          write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module
          <br />to help you. Here we teach object theory and syntax in detail,
          look at how to create your own objects, and explain what JSON data is
          and how to work with it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Asynchronous JavaScript</p>
      <ul type="none">
        <li>
          In this module we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is
          important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential
          blocking operations such <br />as fetching resources from a server.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Client-side Web API's</p>
      <ul type="none">
        <li>
          When writing client-side JavaScript for web sites or applications, you
          won't go very far before you start to use APIs — interfaces for
          manipulating different <br />aspects of the browser and operating
          system the site is running on, or even data from other web sites or
          services. In this module we will explore what APIs are, <br />and how
          to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your
          development work.
