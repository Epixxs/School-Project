    <h2>HTML:HyperText Markup Language</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4px">
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
        Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. <br />Other
        technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
        appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
        either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
        fundamental aspect of the Web- <br />
        uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by
        other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags",
        which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". <br />The
        name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
