    <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4px">
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
        the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML <br />(including
        XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
        should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
        across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. <br />Previously,
        the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
        synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
        recommendations. <br />You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
        CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now
        CSS without a version number.
      </p>
      <p>
        After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly
        and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much,<br />
        that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
        separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
        <br />W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state
        of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. <br />CSS
        modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module
        Level 5

        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, 
        to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, 
        or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your 
        path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you 
        can start using it to add styling to HTML.
