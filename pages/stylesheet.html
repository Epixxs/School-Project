    <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4px">
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
        the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML <br />(including
        XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
        should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
        across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. <br />Previously,
        the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
        synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
        recommendations. <br />You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
        CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now
        CSS without a version number.
      </p>
      <p>
        After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly
        and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much,<br />
        that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
        separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
        <br />W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state
        of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. <br />CSS
        modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module
        Level 5

      Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from the
      ground up — no previous knowledge required.

    <br />
    <p>CSS first steps</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for
        example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content,
        <br />split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
        decorative features.This module provides a gentle beginning to your path
        towards CSS mastery <br />with the basics of how it works, what the
        syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
        HTML.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>CSS Building Blocks</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
        gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic
        experience with using it, <br />it's time to dive a bit deeper. This
        module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we
        have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders,
        <br />debugging, and lots more.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>CSS layouts</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style
        text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits
        inside. Now it's time to look at <br />how to place your boxes in the
        right place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have
        covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS
        layout, <br />looking at different display settings, modern layout tools
        like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy
        techniques you might still want to know about.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>CSS styling text</p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you
        to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll
        do with CSS. <br />Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including
        setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows,
        and other text features. We round off the module by <br />looking at
        applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
