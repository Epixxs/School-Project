    <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
      presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects
      such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
      rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across
      Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development
      of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which
      allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard
      about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4;
      rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.
    </p>
    <p>
      After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and
      the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it
      became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately
      per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now
      periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS
      specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have
      version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5

      Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from the
      ground up — no previous knowledge required.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>CSS first steps</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for
        example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content,
        split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
        features.This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards
        CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like,
        and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>CSS Building Blocks</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
        gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic
        experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module
        looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have
        available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging,
        and lots more.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>CSS layouts</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style
        text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits
        inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right
        place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered
        the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout,
        looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox,
        CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might
        still want to know about.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>CSS styling text</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you
        to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll
        do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including
        setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows,
        and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying
        custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
